# my-user-profile
 Web App Class

 To ensure immutability while updating nested state in my React app, I used the spread operator to create copies of objects before making any changes. This method allowed me to update the user profile's nested address while not directly modifying the original state, preserving its structure and ensuring predictable behavior.
